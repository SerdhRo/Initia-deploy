# How to Set Up Minita: A Deployment Guide
This guide will help you set up Minita, an automated environment for deploying applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Node.js version 16 or higher installed.

npm version 7 or higher installed.

Access to the Initia repository and deployment server.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub or your Git server. You can do this by using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/minitia.git
```
Once cloned, navigate into the project directory:

```
cd minitia
```
## Step 2: Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, you need to install the project dependencies using npm. Run the following command:

```
npm install
```
This will install all required packages specified in package.json.

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Minita requires some environment-specific configurations. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables:

```
touch .env
```
Hereâ€™s an example of what your .env file might look like:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
API_URL=https://api.yourapp.com
```
Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual environment details.

## Step 4: Build the Project

Once your environment variables are set up, build the project by running the following command:

```
npm run build
```
This compiles your project into a production-ready state.

## Step 5: Run the Application

To start the application locally for testing or development, use the following command:

```
npm start
```
The app should now be running, and you can access it at http://localhost:3000 or the port specified in your configuration.

## Step 6: Deploying to Production

To deploy Minita in a production environment, follow these steps:

Build the Production Version

Before deploying, ensure the project is built for production:

```
npm run build
```
Deploy the Code

Use your preferred deployment method (e.g., SSH, FTP, or a continuous integration (CI) tool) to upload the built files to your server.

Set up Server Configuration

Ensure your server is configured to point to the entry point of the application. For example, with NGINX or Apache, you would set the root directory to the build folder.

Restart the Server
After deploying the code, restart the server to apply the changes.
