# How to Set Up Entropy: A Deployment Guide

To set up a validator node for the Entropy network, follow these steps. This guide provides detailed instructions, including code snippets and commands to ensure you can get your node running efficiently.

### 1. **System Requirements**
Ensure your system meets the following specifications:
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu preferred) or macOS.
- **Node.js**: Version 20.9.0 or higher (check using `node --version`).
- **NPM**: Version 7 or higher (check using `npm --version`).

### 2. **Install the Entropy CLI**
The CLI is the primary tool to interact with the Entropy network.

```bash
npm install --global @entropyxyz/cli
```

Once installed, you can verify it using:

```bash
entropy --version
```

### 3. **Set Up an Entropy Account**
Run the Entropy CLI to create or import an account:

```bash
entropy
```

1. Navigate to **Manage Accounts** and choose **Create/Import Account**.
2. When prompted, type `n` to create a new key.
3. Name your account, and the CLI will generate an address like this:

   ```
   {
       name: MyValidatorAccount
       address: 5HMnksPMRPqsDqyCj31VoQFgpiswsr12bk2YTyfMUEKCm2bv
   }
   ```

   Save the address, as you'll need it for future steps.

### 4. **Obtain Test Funds**
To participate in the network and validate transactions, you need test funds:
1. Log in to GitHub and visit [Entropyâ€™s community discussions](https://github.com/entropyxyz/community).
2. Start a new discussion under **Get Test Funds**.
3. Provide your account address and request the desired amount of test tokens. Wait for the Entropy team to approve and transfer the funds.

### 5. **Register Your Validator Node**
Registering your node announces it to the network:

1. Go back to the CLI main menu and select **Register**.
2. The CLI will confirm if your address is successfully registered.

```bash
? Select Action
  Manage Accounts
> Register
```

The CLI should output a success message if everything is set up correctly.

### 6. **Configure the Validator Node**
To configure your validator node:
1. Ensure your environment variables and settings are correctly set up (e.g., node ID, IP addresses). The configuration files are typically stored in the `.entropy` directory.
2. Follow instructions specific to setting up node encryption and communication protocols as detailed in the [Entropy documentation](https://docs.entropy.xyz).

### 7. **Run the Validator**
Finally, start your validator node. Use the CLI or directly run the node binary from your terminal:

```bash
entropy start-validator --config /path/to/config/file
```

Monitor the logs to confirm that your node is syncing with the network and validating blocks correctly.
